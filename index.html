							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I am a Data Scientist with background in Mechanical Engineering who is inspired by automotive
							and techologies.
							<br>
							Previously as a Mechanical Engineer, I developed skills in breaking down problems into
							smaller subsets and
							implented data into mechanical or hardware design.
							<br>
							With my techincal background and analytical skills, I
							take deep dive into data to explore creative ways to
							answer my
							questions. Thus, I am thrived to make
							contributions to improve our future in artificial intelligence.
							</br>
							<br>
							Outside of professional work, you can find me taking part of another culture somewhere in
							the world, snowboarding down a slope, enjoying a music event, singing karaoke,
							hiking through nature, playing badminton or shooting basketball. Also, I can simply be at
							home enjoying a glass of
							wine with a book, watching movies, browsing on new technologies or flight deals. </p>

					<p>
						Car Classification with Imagery
						<br>
						<br>
						Motivation: To mobilize car research experience for car buyers and sellers, given
						mobile device usage has surpassed 53% (Autotrader). This application will allow buyer/seller to
						upload a car
						image and it will return relevant information about the car. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The model is built on neural network with Tensorflow/Keras and achieved accuracy of 98%.
						Currently limited to 4 models, Jeep Renegade, Jaguar F-Type, BMW i8 and BMW M4, while it is
						still in development.

				<h2>Client Project: Flood Detection with Imagery (Flood Bank) </h2>
			</header>
			<div class="project">
				<span class="image"><img src="images/pic49.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>
					Motivation: As natural disaster is happening and impacting people's lives, can we use images to
					detect severity of the flood to allow emergency managers and those who may be impacted to get
					an early preparation?  
					<br>
					<br>
					In a group of 3, without prior knowledge working with images at the time, we decided to take on
					the challenge to
					execute this concept. We built a web scraper tool to collected flood images. Then, we built a binary
					classification model and a flood
					depth detection model. In conjunction, they can filter a large collection of images to flood images
					and
					then approximate flood depth for those images.
					<br>
					<br>
					Even though the current accuracy is about 68%, this project is still in development for
					improvements.

				<h2>NLP Classification between BMW E46 & E90 </h2>

			<div class="project">
				<span class="image"><img src="images/bmw.png" alt="" /></span>
				<p>
					Goal: Use NLP to classify subreddit post between BWM E46 & E90.
					<br>
					<br>
					Used PushShift's API to gather around 2000 posts each for E46 and E90. Cleaned the posts to exclude
					HTML artifacts, links and punctuations. It resulted in total of 2400 posts. The posts were used
					into multiple classification models with CounterVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer. Classification
					models
					consisted of Logistic Regression, KNearest Neighbor, Navies Bayes Mulitinomials and Decision Trees.
					The best model was Logistic Regression with CounterVectorizer at about 86% and TfidfVectorizer at
					about 85%.

				<h2>Kaggle: Predicting House Prices (Housetradamus) </h2>
			</header>
			<div class="project">
				<span class="image"><img src="images/Project 2 House.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>
					<br>
					<br>
					Goal: Given a set of features of a house, such as location, lot area, can we predict the house
					price in
					Ames, Iowa?  
					<br>
					<br>
					With the given 80+ house features, not every features will have a significant impact
					on house prices. Thus, I used EDA to clean and extract features with important correlation.

					These features were used in a Linear Regression model. I also incorporated regularization with Ridge
					and LassoCV to reduce mean square error. As the result, the best model with Lasso achieved 18.611K
					MSE in private leaderboard, which ranked 2nd among my class and 4th within General Assembly Data
					Science Classes.
